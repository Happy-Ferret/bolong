Start with this annotated example JSON config file when creating your own config file:

	{
		 // "kind" must be either "googles3" or "local". for "local", field "local" below is used. for "googles3", the "googles3" field. simple.
		"kind": "googles3",


		"local": {
			// where to store backup files on the local file system (which could be mounted over the network)
			"path": "../x"
		},


		"googles3": {
			// for your account
			"accessKey": "GOOGLTEST123456789",
			"secret": "bm90IGEgcmVhbCBrZXkuIG5pY2UgdHJ5IHRob3VnaCBeXg==",

			// create your bucket first, we won't create it for you
			"bucket": "your-bucket-name",

			// directory within your backup to store the files in.
			// it should be either "/", or any other path that starts and ends with a slash.
			"path": "/optional/subdir/"
		},

		// if this list is non-empty, only files that match one of these regular expressions will be included in the bacup. this has no effect on restore.
		// directories always end with a slash.  paths never start with a slash. the root directory is matched as the empty string.
		// if a directory isn't included, the entire hierarchy rooted at that directory is included, even if files would match one of the includes.
		"include": [
			"^$",
			"\\.go$"
		],

		// similar to "include", but if a path matches one of these regular expressions, it will not be included in the backup (even if the path matches on of the "include"s).
		"exclude": [
			"\\.png$"
		],

		// how many incrementals will be created before doing a full backup again. for a weekly full backup, set this to 6.
		"incrementalsPerFull": 2,

		// how many full backups to keep.  after each backup, older backups will be cleaned up.
		"fullKeep": 5,

		// for how many full backups we keep incremental backups.
		"incrementalForFullKeep": 3,

		// the passphrase used to encrypt the backup files (after key derivation, with per-file salt).
		"passphrase": "your secret keyphrase"
	}
